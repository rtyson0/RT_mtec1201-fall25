/*
______LINES OOP QUIZ_______
Add Following Functionality:

  When mouse is pressed...
    - Line object is added to array and drawn from center position to mouse position.
	    - BONUS: make it so the opacity, stroke, and strokeWeight are randomized on that new object.
  When any key is pressed...
    - the whole image resets, the starting lines are redrawn with new random values
